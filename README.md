his repository contains assignments and practice projects I have completed while studying and learning about Python, Google Earth Engine (GEE), GIS, and water/environmental data analysis.


The scripts here are primarily from coursework, tutorials, and as part of my self-learning process.

This repo is not intended to showcase  my learning journey as I improve my coding skills.

🧪 What’s Inside

Remote Sensing (GEE + Python): Land cover classification (e.g. Narok LULC), NDVI/EVI vegetation monitoring, suitability mapping.

Water Quality Analysis: Statistical analysis (regression, ANOVA, PCA) using Python, applied to water quality datasets.

GIS & Mapping: Assignments in QGIS and Python geospatial libraries (geopandas, rasterio).

📚 Learning Goals

Through these projects I am:

Practicing Python programming for geospatial applications.

Working with Google Earth Engine (JavaScript + Python API).

Applying statistical analysis to environmental and water data.

Exploring how remote sensing and GIS can support climate resilience and conservation works.

🚀 Usage

This repo is for educational purposes only. If you reuse or adapt any scripts, please check original sources or datasets for proper citation.
